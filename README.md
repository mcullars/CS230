For this project I acted as a consultant for Creative Technology Solutions.  Our cient The Game Room enlisted our services to futher expand their game on different operating systems.  This software design doc. lists my recommendations on how the company should do this.  The process of completing this document helped with the creation of the code for The Game Room.  It made the priorities of the client clear and showed me where to focus in my development phase.  Getting the customer requirements correct is important to producing quality code.  When attempting to develop code I always try to keep in mind what is required so the end product can be functional and the solution to the problem presented.  A portion of the software design document that I felt I did well was listing the pros and cons of the different operating systems.  I feel that I gave useful points to make a informed decision.  One section I would like to revise is the recommendations section.  I feel more detail could be placed on the security aspect and what the customer will need to build on the platform.  Security was key point for my customer and I feel more attention should have been placed on the security recommendations.
